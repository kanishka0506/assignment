                <b>Technology</b> is the application of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge">knowledge</a>
                to
                reach
                practical goals in a specifiable and
                reproducible way. <br> The word technology may also mean the product of such an endeavor. <br>
                The use of technology is widely prevalent in medicine, science, industry, communication,
                transportation, and daily life. <br>
                Technologies include physical objects like utensils or machines and
                intangible tools such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software"> software</a>. <br>
            </p>

            <p>Many technological advancements have led to societal changes.
                The earliest known technology is the stone tool, used in the prehistoric era, followed by fire
                use, which contributed to the growth of the human brain and the development of language in the
                Ice Age. <sup>[1]</sup> <br> The invention of the wheel in the Bronze Age enabled wider travel and the
                creation
                of
                more complex machines. <br> Recent technological developments, including the printing press,
                the telephone, and the Internet have lowered communication barriers and ushered in the
                knowledge economy. <sup> <a href="somesource.com">[2]</a> </sup> <br>

            <h2>Etymology</h2>
            <p>Technology is a term dating back to the early 17th century that meant 'systematic treatment'
                (from Greek Τεχνολογία, from τέχνη 'art, craft' and -λογία, 'study, knowledge'). <br>
                It is predated in use by the Ancient Greek τέχνη, used to mean 'knowledge of how to make things',
                which encompassed activities like architecture. <br> </p>

            <h2>History</h2>

            <h3>Ancient</h3>
            <p>After harnessing fire, humans discovered other forms of energy. <br> The earliest known use of wind power
                is the sailing ship; the earliest record of a ship under sail is that of a Nile boat dating to
                around 7,000 BCE. <br> From prehistoric times, Egyptians likely used the power of the annual
                flooding of the Nile to irrigate their lands, gradually learning to regulate much of it through
                purposely built irrigation channels and "catch" basins. <br> The ancient Sumerians in Mesopotamia
                used a complex system of canals and levees to divert water from the Tigris and Euphrates rivers
                for irrigation. <br>
            </p>


            <h3>Modern</h3>
            <p>Starting in the United Kingdom in the 18th century, the discovery of steam power set off the
                Industrial Revolution, which saw wide-ranging technological discoveries, particularly in the
                areas of agriculture, manufacturing, mining, metallurgy, and transport, and the widespread
                application of the factory system. <br> This was followed a century later by the Second Industrial
                Revolution which led to rapid scientific discovery, standardization, and mass production. <br>
                New technologies were developed, including sewage systems, electricity, light bulbs,
                electric motors, railroads, automobiles, and airplanes. These technological advances led
                to significant developments in medicine, chemistry, physics, and engineering. <br>
                They were accompanied by consequential social change, with the introduction of
                skyscrapers accompanied by rapid urbanization. <br> Communication improved with the
                invention of the telegraph, the telephone, the radio, and television. <br>
